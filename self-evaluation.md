# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
--**"I feel as though reading an each loop makes sense. All elements of an iterable are cycled through and the format is easily digested."**
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
--**"I do have some background knowledge that was helpful in my finishing the work. Ruby is different from other languages in many ways though."**
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
--**"I don't believe that an adjustment of my calendar will be necessary. My biggest hurdle when using the each loop was in it's lack of a standard index value to draw from. I did find that Ruby has a built-in method which allows the use of an index counter so the transition should be much smoother now."**
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
--**"Googling helped me to find the each_with_index method that I was yearning for. I believe if I have any other questions I will consult with my team as well."**
